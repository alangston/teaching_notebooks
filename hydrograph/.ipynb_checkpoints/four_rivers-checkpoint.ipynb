    "A hydrograph shows discharge, Q, in a river or stream through time. Certain characteristics of a single envent in a hydrograph can inform us about the processes that are acting in a watershed, for example how water is delivered from hillslopes to channels. Longer term (yearly) trends in hydrographs generally reflect larger scale controls on discharge such as climate and size of the drainage basin. \n",
