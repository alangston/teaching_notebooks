    "## Loops in Python\n",
    "#### Why Use Loops\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A loop is a sequence of operations that are performed over and over in some specified order, until a specified condition is met. There are two main types of loops we'll look at: **for loops** and **while loops**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Loops can help you to eliminate repetition in code by replacing duplicate lines of code with an iteration, meaning that you can iteratively execute the same code line or block until it reaches a specified end point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of copying and pasting the same code over and over to run it multiple times (say, on multiple variables or files), you can create a loop that contains one instance of the code and that executes that code block on a range or list of values that you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of using loops\n",
    "- Running a numerical model over many time steps\n",
    "* Making a series of figures showing change through time\n",
    "* Importing a set of data files\n",
    "\n",
    "Our most common application of for loops will be in the context of landscape changes through time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For loops\n",
    "A **For Loop** repeats a set of actions for every item in a collection (every letter in a word, every number in some range, every name in a list) until it runs out of items:\n",
    "The general form of a for loop is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "for item in collection:\n",
    "    do things with item\n",
    "`\n",
    "#### Formatting For loops\n",
    "A for loop starts with the word `for`, then the variable name that each item in the collection is going to take inside the loop, then the word `in`, and then the collection or sequence of items to loop through. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line must end with a colon `:`. The commands that are run repeatedly inside the loop are *indented* below the first line that ends wiht a colon. Unlike many other languages, there is no command to end a loop (e.g. end for): the loop ends once the indentation moves back to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, the following lines execute a for loop that iterates over an array of values and executes the print() function until it reaches the end of the list:"

    "### While Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop is used to iteratively execute code until a pre-defined condition is no longer satisfied (i.e. results in a value of `False`). That condition could be a limit on how many times you want the code to run, or that results of the code reach a certain value (e.g. code will iteratively execute as long as the current value of the results is less than 5). After the pre-defined condition is no longer `True`, the loop will not execute another iteration.\n",

    "\n",
    "This example below uses a while loop to iteratively add a value of 1 to a variable x, as long as the current value of x does not exceed a specified value. In this example, a comparison operator (e.g. <) is used to compare the value of x (which begins with value of 0) to the value 10, the designated end point. Within the loop, an assignment operator (+=) is used to add a value of 1 to x, and the current value of x is printed. This process repeats each time that the code iterates, until the current value of x is no longer less than 10."

    "## Conditional Statements in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A conditional statement is used to determine whether a certain condition exists before code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements can help improve the efficiency of your code by providing you with the ability to control the flow of your code, such as when or how code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be very useful for checking whether a certain condition exists before the code begins to execute, as you may want to only execute certain code lines when certain conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, conditional statements can be used to check that a certain variable or file exists before code is executed, or to execute more code if some criteria is met, such as a calculation resulting in a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of Conditional Statements\n",
    "A conditional statement uses a syntax structure based on `if` and `else` statements (each ending with a colon `:`) that define the potential actions that can be completed based on whether the condition is true or not:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    some code here\n",
    "else:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Indentation and Execution of Code Lines\n",
    "Note that the indentations for the code lines after `if` and `else` are an important part of the syntax of conditional statements. These indentations indicate which code should be executed with which statement, and they make the code easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples above and below, the code following the `if` and `else` statements can actually be replaced by any code that will execute in Python. For example, you could choose to perform some calculations on the data, use one analysis method vs. antoher, plot data, etc. depending on whether the condition is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compare Numeric Values Using Conditional Statements\n",
    "You can write conditional statements that use comparison operators (e.g. equal to ==, less than <) to check the value of a variable against some other value or variable.\n",

    "Let's go back to `for` loops to work with some examples.\n",
