    "Here, $K$ is the erodibility coefficient on fluvial incision, which is thought to be positively correlated with climate wetness, or storminess (this is hard to quantify) and to be negatively correlated with rock strength (again, rock strength is hard to quantify). $m$ and $n$ are positive exponents, usually thought to have a ratio, $m/n \\approx 0.5$. $A$ is drainage area and $S$ is the slope of steepest descent ($-\\frac{dz}{dx}$) where $x$ is horizontal distance (positive in the downslope direction) and $z$ is elevation. (If slope is negative there is no fluvial erosion.) $U$ is an externally-applied rock uplift field.\n",
